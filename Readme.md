# Jwt visualizer

Simply tool that can visualize any pasted Jwt token locally.

Uses smart trimming so you can paste "{Bearer ...}", "   ey..." and other slightly malformed Jwt tokens and it will still parse correctly.

Also displays timestamp in human readable format and warns when a token is expired.
